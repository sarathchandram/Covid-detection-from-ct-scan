# covid_from_ctscan
I have built a model which can predict COVID-19 positive case from axial lung CT-scan images.This work is my personal project and I in no way claim my work can be used universally,or state that my work is accurate.

# Hypothesis and Data
I have noticed in the internet how researchers have noticed white patches in the boundary of lung CT scans.This gave me motivation to develop a model which can detect the probablity of a CT scan,affected with COVID-19.The videos([a](https://youtu.be/3ttAFm9wKPg) and [b](https://youtu.be/xUuNr_EFlBM)) attached explains in a better way.

Coming to the data collection I have used three public data sources:-
1.[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/luisblanche/covidct)
2.[Github](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)
3.[Github](https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid/tree/master/data)

I belive that the data is accurate andI ensured that  no image is repeated by me while modelling.
