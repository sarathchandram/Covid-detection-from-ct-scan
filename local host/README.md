To run the localhost:-
Clone the entire localhost folder. To install(or rather make sure you have them all installed) all the libraries required to run the localhost, run the file requirements.txt. Download the pre-trained weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-CkZVLj7Dutf4CVGFcQt-nV-4P9e62Bl/view?usp=sharing).

Running app.py in the local machine would give the link to the locally hosted website.
